# Swarm Social DApp

This is a decentralized social networking DApp built on Swarm + Polygon, enabling users to create profiles, post content, and interact via a feed. 

## Core objectives:

- Store all user-generated content on Swarm for permanence and censorship resistance
- Anchor references and metadata on Polygon for verifiability
- Provide modular messaging primitives with future end-to-end encryption

The app addresses the gap in Web3 social media: decentralized storage exists, but there is no user-friendly, privacy-respecting social layer that is fully integrated with on-chain identity. Users gain control over their data while maintaining discoverability through verifiable on-chain references.


### Contribution to Swarm Ecosystem

- Demonstrates real-world application of Swarm as storage for social DApps
- Validates content discovery workflows via Polygon-anchored references
- Encourages adoption by providing a usable, modular social platform for end-users
- Prepares the ecosystem for future features like encrypted messaging, feeds, and DApp plugins
